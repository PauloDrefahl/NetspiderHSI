Docker PostgreSQL Setup Instructions

This document provides instructions for setting up and managing a PostgreSQL database using Docker. 
Using Docker ensures consistent environments for all developers and simplifies database management.

Prerequisites
- Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running on your machine.
- Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file before running the commands below.

Commands

Starting the Database
To start the PostgreSQL container, run:

docker-compose up -d


Stopping and Removing the Database
To stop and remove the PostgreSQL container, run:

docker-compose down -v


Viewing Logs
To view the logs of the PostgreSQL container, run:

docker logs netspider_postgres_db

Accessing the Database
To access the PostgreSQL database using `psql`, run:

docker exec -it netspider_postgres_db psql -U postgres -d netspider


Explanation of Commands
- `docker exec` is used to execute commands in the container.
- `netspider_postgres_db` is the container name.
- `psql` is the PostgreSQL CLI tool.
- `-U postgres` specifies the default user.
- `-d netspider` specifies the database to connect to.

Using the above instructions, you should be able to have a Docker PostgreSQL container up, running, and manageable. 
The reason for using Docker is to ensure consistent environments for all developers and to gain experience with Docker, which is beneficial for your resume.
